            <h3 class="lead">  About our Firm : </h3><hr>

            <p>We started off in 2010, having discovered the extreme depricated health services conditions in Nigeria. Medical care in Nigeria has been faced with a great challenge of reachability, as more than half of its populace cannot access adequate medical care. As a result, people living in these remote rural areas have limited access to basic healthcare services and consequently receive lower quality of healthcare service compared to those in urban areas where best equipped hospitals and medical experts are available. <br> Also, people in urban areas would need an avenue through which they can access medical care or basic check-up without their physical presence at the hospital, either due to their busy schedule or to avoid waiting in a long queue just to consult a medical specialist. <br> We developed a web-based telemedicine system called Virtual Clinic to bridge the gap between health care systems and individuals who would rather not be physically present for medical care. The system will focus on improving upon the quality of medical services, lower cost of delivering such service especially for the people in remote areas, and providing more up-to-date medical information to rural healthcare workers demarcated from the main stream of information awareness.</p>

            <br>
            <h4>Our Mission :</h4><hr>
            Our mission is to reach out to the masses who cannot access medical care, in order to maintain their health and give medical practitioners the privilege of expanding their expertise to more people. We also bring artificial intelligence in saving lives and giving medical advice to people who are victims of heart problems. All these are to be done from the comfort of your home at affordable cost.

            <h4><strong>OUR VISION</strong></h4>
            <p>Our vision is to make our organization a profound telemedicine service provider reaching out to Nigerians and the rest of Africa in the nearest future. Consult A will also be extending its functionality into technological surgeries.</p>
            
                <h4>OUR STRATEGY</h4>
                <p>Our strategy is to partner with NGOs, Hospitals, Specialists, Pharmacies, Telecommunication companies and National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in Nigeria to bring about a complete telemedical system in which telemedical services exist for every type of ailment. NGOs will help take these services and training to rural areas.</p>

                <h4>Our Services</h4>
                <p>
                  We at Consult A would offer the following services:<br>

                  <strong>mHealth</strong> - This deals with accessing healthcare through your mobile device on our user friendly application.<br>
                  <strong>Remote Patient Monitoring</strong> - This involves monitoring the most essential health statistics of patients remotely. This is mainly useful for patients with chronic diseases or patients who just got discharged from hospital. Our approach is aimed at diabetics and patients with cardiovascular problems.<br>
                  <strong>Chat bot</strong> - This is a two way live interaction between a patient and healthcare giver. It is used with patients suffering from common illness, where the doctor will be able to see and diagnose the patient, prescribe medication and also be able to tell if the patient need to visit the hospital in person. This service is also used in providing psychotherapy sessions.<br>
                  <strong>Predictive medicine</strong> - We deploy machine learning solutions to cater for patients in the area of cardiovascular medicine. Patients will record the diastolic and systolic readings to our web application. The algorithm will calculate the systolic/diastolic rates of the patient and predict the possibilty of having a heart attack. The algorithm will also prescribe solutions for example rest/taking drugs formerly prescribed to the patient or visiting the hospital, depending on the readings it gets from the patient.<br>
                  <strong>Health education and awareness</strong> - The web application will also provide education services to teach people who are subscribed to us basic medical education, a healthy lifestyle and first aid techniques.
